              Case management is the process of ensuring an organization’s cases
              are accounted for, deployed, maintained, upgraded, and disposed of
              when the time comes. Put simply, it’s making sure that the
              valuable items, tangible and intangible, in your organization are
              tracked and being used. The example on the left demonstrates how
              easy and fluid TopOneCRM case management tool really is!
